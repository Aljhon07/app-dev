#### Synopsis
Yang Hao (He Shengming) and his daughter Yuan Yuan (Zhang Mingcan) are on the run. Not so long ago, plants mutated after an experiment, they adapted too well to the new environment, and at the same time, developed a collective memory. So now, there is a huge root system under the earth's surface that repeatedly breaks through the ground and takes over entire cities. For humans, life on earth is no longer possible, as nature has reclaimed it. The only thing that still manages to push the plants back at least a little is UV light. One day, Yang Hao is woken up in this post-apocalyptic world by plants engulfing his daughter and her bed in the abyss, but when he follows the GPS signal of her watch, he finally finds her. However, he stands no chance against the plants that have surrounded them. Suddenly, a special military unit turns up and the two are saved. Next to the leader of the team (Yu Rongguang) and other members, Li Mo (Mi Luo) and Ye Yan (Michelle Ye) are responsible for bringing a substance to a specific place where it can be injected into the roots of the plant system. It is humanity's last hope to reclaim earth. Since the unit's technician died while rescuing Yang Hao, and because Yang has proven to be an excellent engineer, he is asked to help with the mission. Yang Hao immediately says no, but his daughter on the other hand would like to save the world.
